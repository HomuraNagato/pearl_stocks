** MA (moving average)

 - A moving average takes the previous n days of values, and averages it. This has the effect
   of softening volatility to illustrate trends in an investment. Larger MA's have a delay
   before they capture trends in the market

** EMA (exponential moving average)

 - exponential value of MA
 - reacts more significantly to recent price changes, rather than MA
